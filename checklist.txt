I.The program runs
1.detect hand and mark all the hand knuckles-y
2.Now calculate the distance of each detected finger from the screen and display the screen-y
3.Establish what would be the best distnace suhc that tracking is optimal-afterwards
4.Display the darts on the screen-y
5.To be able to grab the dart and move the dart on will-y
6.To be able to throw the dart as the distance of the 
index finger and thumb finger reaches a threshold distance -y
7.calculate Threshold distance for launching -afterwards
8.To be able to detect if the dart hits the screen and print if it 
hits and calculate what distance should be optimal for scoring-y
9.Develop the gravity simulation.
10.Develop the air flow obstruction sumulation
10.Include multiple darts and create a separate module class for darts and update score accordindly
NOte : step to be modified if using in windows  cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0,CAP_DSHOW)
check for your resolution and modify the code accordingly
The program runs optimally if the left side to hand is higly illuminate          
II.Optimallity






-----------------
first capture the first frame and then initialse the frame with the dart and 
now make a separate class for dart mechanics which will manage the 
positions of dart separetly

The question is what to do with the dart that has been thrown??
As soon as the dart is thrown that particular dart position should be out of the screen
